## Featured Projects  

### 1. Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning (Research Project)  
- ML comparison of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and MLP for localized rainfall prediction.  
- Achieved predictive accuracy up to **83%** using real rainfall data from self-built rain gauges.

### 4. Drip Irrigation Design Android App  
- Cordova-based Android tool for irrigation engineers.  
- Performs **pipe sizing, pressure loss calculations, daily irrigation scheduling, and system checks**.
- https://github.com/hobbybwanali/Drip-Irrigation-Design-Android-App-using-Codova-framework  

### 5. GoBible Android App (80% complete)  
- Multi-version Bible app with hymns for all major denominations in Malawi.  
- Includes devotions, announcements, and church events.  
- Built purely in **Kotlin**.  

### 6. Concrete Batching & Surveying Desktop App  
- Windows C# application for calculating **concrete mix ratios, BS/FS levels, area from survey coordinates, and cost estimates**.
